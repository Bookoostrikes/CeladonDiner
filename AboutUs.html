            Established the year after the Great Kanto War, The Celadon
            Diner sits at the heart of Celadon City on the rooftop of the
            Celadon Department Store. The early years of the resutarant's
            operations were a challenge for the first owner, Free Surge, as
            the local residents of Kanto were uneasy after the war, mentally
            and finacially. However, this did not stop Surge from spreading
            his love of Pokemon and cuisuine to the residents of Celadon City.

            As time went on, more and more people and Pokemon grew to love
            and appreciate The Celadon Diner for what it is, a high-class,
            luxurious diner where one can rest and unwind after a long day.
            What attracted people to the diner is its battling incentive
            program. One could waiver their bill, if they could beat Free Surge
            in a Pokemon battle. Although many failed, the ectasy of battling
            filled the hearts of many and overtime, The Celadon Diner grew to
            what it is today.
